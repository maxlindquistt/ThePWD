# ThePWD

A small Personal Web Desktop (PWD) — a collection of tiny web applications assembled into a desktop-like UI.

This project was developed during my first year as a web development student as part of the course 1DV025 at Linnaeus University. It was created to practice building modular front-end components, client-side application structure, and basic UI/UX using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

What you'll find here
- A simple desktop UI that hosts several micro-apps (Hangman, Memory, Messages)
- A component-based folder structure under `src/js/components/` for each app
- Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript (a Vite setup is present in the repository for development convenience)

Installation

Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine (Node 16+ recommended).

Local development
1. From the project root, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server (uses Vite):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown in the terminal (by default Vite serves at http://localhost:5173).

Build and preview production bundle

```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
```

`npm run serve` runs a local preview of the production build (Vite preview).

Notes
